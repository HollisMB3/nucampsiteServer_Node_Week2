For the most part I am still a toddler at all of this.
My obsession for solving problems and taking notes is real however and I am currently 
commited to learning how to build my own apps from the ground up.

Class will be over soon and I'll have to move on with my obsession with learning Javascript.
Hopefully I can actually acomplish something with it and not simply fall down my usual 
hole of just wanting to "learn stuff" 


Other than that I don't really know what notes to put here aside from 
the beligerantly long list of file notes I do have.
